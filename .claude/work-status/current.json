  "notes": "USER INSTRUCTION: Run /implementation-review AGAIN before fixing anything. Go deeper. Do additional passes to find more issues. Work serially (no agents).\n\n## PLAN\n1. Read the existing review report: .claude/audit-reports/2026-02-09-implementation-review.md\n2. Read the spec review report: .claude/audit-reports/2026-02-09-spec-review-serial-pass9.md\n3. Run additional implementation review passes that go DEEPER than the first 6 passes:\n   - Pass 7: Cross-layer consistency — verify entities, repos, use cases, DAOs, and tables all agree on the same fields/types/signatures for each domain. The first 6 passes checked each layer independently; this pass checks them TOGETHER.\n   - Pass 8: Test coverage audit — verify tests actually test what they claim. Check that test assertions match spec requirements, not just 'does it compile'.\n   - Pass 9: Provider wiring — verify Riverpod providers pass correct dependencies to use cases, repos match their impls, and provider return types match use case outputs.\n   - Pass 10: Data flow integrity — trace a complete create/read/update/delete flow for 2-3 entities end-to-end (entity → use case → repo interface → repo impl → DAO → table) to find mismatches that per-layer reviews miss.\n4. Append findings to the existing audit report as Passes 7-10\n5. Update cumulative totals\n6. Do NOT fix any issues yet — review only\n7. After all passes complete, update status to 'complete' with full issue list for the NEXT instance to fix\n\n## CONTEXT\n- Previous review (passes 1-6 + gap analysis) found 38 issues: 11 HIGH, 12 MEDIUM, 15 LOW\n- Full report at .claude/audit-reports/2026-02-09-implementation-review.md\n- Spec is at 22_API_CONTRACTS.md (14,000+ lines)\n- Coding standards at 02_CODING_STANDARDS.md\n- 1205 tests passing, analyzer clean\n\n## AFTER REVIEW COMPLETE\nThe instance AFTER this one will fix ALL issues (original 23 + any new ones found). That instance should read the full updated report and fix everything."
