  "notes": "996 tests passing, 0 analyzer issues, code formatted. Two commits made: (1) Phase 3 screen implementations with all 37 test failures fixed, all 17 snackbar calls converted to showAccessibleSnackBar, all lint issues resolved. (2) Added 7 edit mode tests for ConditionEditScreen removing dead code suppression. REMAINING WORK: (1) Document Category required-vs-optional spec conflict in 53_SPEC_CLARIFICATIONS.md. (2) Implement remaining screens from 38_UI_FIELD_SPECIFICATIONS.md (Log Supplement Intake 4.2, Log Food 5.1, Log Condition Entry 8.2, more). (3) condition_edit_screen.dart line 540 has TODO for update method - ConditionList provider only has create(), no update. Next instance should continue with remaining screens or Phase 3 completion."
