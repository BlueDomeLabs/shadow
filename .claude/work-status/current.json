  "notes": "Phase 21 complete. Added String? timeToFallAsleep, int? timesAwakened, String? timeAwakeDuringNight to SleepEntry entity. Added 3 columns to sleep_entries table. Bumped schema v17→v18 with addColumn migration. Updated DAO rowToEntity and entityToCompanion. Added fields to LogSleepEntryInput and UpdateSleepEntryInput. Wired through log and update use cases. Screen already had UI — wired initState to read from entity and _onSave to pass to inputs. 4 new use case unit tests + 1 DB migration test. 3,278 tests passing. Analyzer clean. Next: await Architect review."
