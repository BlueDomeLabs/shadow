  "notes": "Spec review complete. Found 15 violations between 22_API_CONTRACTS.md and 02_CODING_STANDARDS.md. CRITICAL: Error handling architectures are incompatible (semantic vs numeric codes). 6 enums missing explicit int values. ID/SyncMetadata generation pattern conflicts. Recommendation: Use API_CONTRACTS as authoritative, update CODING_STANDARDS to match. Next: User decision on how to proceed with fixes."
