  "notes": "Completed the two remaining screen implementation items: (1) Added min 10 chars content validation to journal entry edit screen _validateContent() method, with 3 new tests. (2) Added _PhotoDetailsDialog to photo entry gallery screen — after selecting a photo, users now see a dialog with Notes text field (max ValidationRules.notesMaxLength) and Date/Time picker (default now, no future dates). Added 3 new tests for the add photo flow. Fixed 2 analyzer infos (use_build_context_synchronously, use_if_null_to_convert_nulls_to_bools). All 1919 tests passing, analyzer clean. Phase 3 Screen Implementation is now COMPLETE. Next: Phase 4 integration testing."
