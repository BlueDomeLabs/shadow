  "notes": "Phase 16c complete. 3 items delivered: (1) HealthPlatformServiceImpl in lib/data/services/health_platform_service_impl.dart — concrete health plugin adapter, only file that imports health package, injects hp.Health for testability; (2) HealthSyncSettingsScreen in lib/presentation/screens/health/health_sync_settings_screen.dart — 4-section settings screen wired into Settings hub; (3) 39 new tests — 14 unit tests for the impl (Mockito mock of hp.Health), 24 widget tests for the screen, 1 settings hub tile test. All tests passing, analyzer clean, schema unchanged (v16). Next: Phase 16d integration testing per 61_HEALTH_PLATFORM_INTEGRATION.md — full end-to-end sync flow, manual test on device with real health data."
