Replaced _buildFoodItemsStub in food_log_screen.dart with real food items section: chips show resolved names, tapping 'Search foods...' opens picker, chip X removes item. 15 new picker tests + 3 food log screen food items section tests = 18 new tests. 3,296 tests passing. Analyzer clean. Next: await Architect review."
