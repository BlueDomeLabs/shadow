  "notes": "Resolved 163 lint issues blocking Phase 3 commit. Changes: (1) Updated spec and implementation - AppError now implements Exception per Dart best practices and existing 02_CODING_STANDARDS.md throw pattern. (2) Updated di_providers.dart to use Ref instead of deprecated FooRef types for Riverpod 3.0 compatibility. All tests passing, flutter analyze reports 'No issues found'. Both issues documented in 53_SPEC_CLARIFICATIONS.md as RESOLVED. Next: Commit Phase 3 work or continue with specialized widgets."
