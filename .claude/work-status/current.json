  "notes": "All 991 tests passing, 0 analyzer issues, code formatted. Fixed all 37 originally failing tests across 6 test files. Key fixes: (1) scrollToBottom/scrollToTop helpers for off-screen ListView content in Flutter test viewport. (2) Mock method overrides (create/updateSupplement) for SupplementList notifier. (3) Condition archived test: status=resolved so it appears in Resolved section. (4) SleepEntry null wakeTime: construct directly bypassing helper's ?? operator. (5) food_item_edit onChanged for real-time name validation. (6) sleep_entry_edit 'times awakened 0': findsWidgets for dual hint+controller text. (7) Supplement success snackbar tests: pump() instead of pumpAndSettle() to catch snackbar before 4s auto-dismiss. (8) All 17 raw ScaffoldMessenger.showSnackBar calls converted to showAccessibleSnackBar per 09_WIDGET_LIBRARY.md spec. (9) All avoid_redundant_argument_values lint issues fixed per Coding Standards. REMAINING: Document spec inconsistency (Category required vs optional) in 53_SPEC_CLARIFICATIONS.md. Next: more screens or Phase 3 completion."
