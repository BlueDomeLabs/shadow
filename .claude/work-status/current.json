Built reports foundation: ActivityCategory/ReferenceCategory/ReportType/ReportConfig domain types, abstract ReportQueryService, ReportQueryServiceImpl (11 repo deps, partial-failure resilient), DI wiring, bootstrap update. Replaced reports_tab.dart placeholder with full ConsumerWidget: two cards opening DraggableScrollableSheets with category checkboxes, date range pickers (Activity), pinned Preview + disabled Export buttons. 12 unit tests + 14 widget tests added (+21 total). Key pattern: action buttons pinned OUTSIDE scrollable area; SingleChildScrollView+Column instead of ListView for eager widget building in tests. Analyzer clean. Next: await Architect review."
