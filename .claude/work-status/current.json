  "notes": "Fixed FastingRepositoryImpl to forward markDirty param to _dao.updateEntity(). Also added markDirty param to FastingSessionDao.updateEntity() signature. Regenerated mocks. Fixes 2-5 from the prompt were already done (activity_log @Default already correct, AccessLevel already has correct values per 22_API_CONTRACTS.md, DatabaseError.transactionFailed already exists, all four entity isActive getters already check syncDeletedAt). 3,396 tests passing, analyzer clean. Next: await Architect review."
