  "notes": "Phase 31b complete. DI: added iCloudProviderProvider + activeCloudProviderProvider to di_providers.dart. Bootstrap: reads stored 'cloud_provider_type' from FlutterSecureStorage (key), instantiates both providers, selects active based on stored preference, overrides all three in ProviderScope, passes activeProvider to SyncServiceImpl. Auth notifier: added ICloudProvider + FlutterSecureStorage params (optional for backward compat); added signInWithICloud(), switchProvider(); updated signOut() to dispatch to correct provider based on state.activeProvider; _checkExistingSession reads stored preference. Setup screen: replaced _showComingSoon with _selectProvider(); updated _buildSignedInSection to show correct provider name. +12 new tests (29 auth provider total, 32 setup screen total). 3432 total passing. Analyzer clean. NOTE: Xcode entitlements still required for iCloud on real device. Provider switching requires app restart for SyncService to use new provider. Next: Phase 32 (TBD by Architect)."
