  "notes": "COMPLETED: Fixed pre-commit hook to only detect unstaged generated files. The hook now correctly allows committing staged generated files while catching unstaged changes. Updated spec in 23_ENGINEERING_GOVERNANCE.md Section 6.1 to match implementation. Pre-commit hook verified working via successful commit. PREVIOUS: Supplement data layer complete. NEXT: Write tests for SupplementDao and SupplementRepositoryImpl."
