  "notes": "Phase 20 complete. Wired camera/photo-library picker into 3 stub screens. Created photo_picker_utils.dart (shared helper). condition_edit_screen: baseline photo wired into CreateConditionInput. condition_log_screen: photoPath wired into LogConditionInput. fluids_entry_screen: bowelPhotoPath wired into both LogFluidsEntryInput and UpdateFluidsEntryInput. 14 new widget tests added (4+5+5). UpdateConditionInput and UpdateConditionLogInput lack photo fields — not wired for edit paths. Analyzer clean. Next: await Architect review."
