  "notes": "Phase A + Phase B COMPLETE. Domain layer updated (snoozed status, mealType, triggers). 4 Tier 1 logging screens implemented: IntakeLog (49 tests), ConditionLog (49 tests), FoodLog (39 tests), FluidsEntry (69 tests). Total: 1205 tests passing, 0 analyzer issues. All changes UNCOMMITTED. SPEC_REVIEW: FluidsEntry has comments about UrineCondition enum gap (spec lists 'Yellow' but enum has 'amber'/'darkYellow') and BowelCondition accessibility label discrepancy (Section 18.5 says 'Bristol stool scale 1 to 7' but Section 6.1 uses named conditions). Next: commit all Phase A + B changes, then continue with remaining screens per 38_UI_FIELD_SPECIFICATIONS.md."
