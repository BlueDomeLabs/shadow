  "notes": "Two convergence /spec-review passes COMPLETE. Fix plan finalized at .claude/plans/spec-review-fix-plan-post-phase2.md with 35 items (all user decisions resolved, all spec-text-only edits to 22_API_CONTRACTS.md). Committed as dbb763e. NEXT STEPS: 1) Execute the 35-item fix plan SERIALLY (user explicitly prefers NO parallel agents for spec work). The plan has 8 phases: error types (5), unchecked Results (7), DateTime (2), duplicates+field names (2), entity definition gaps (2), use case field name (1), mapping tables (10), cross-refs+numbering (6). 2) Run /spec-review to verify convergence to 0 violations. 3) Then proceed with Phase 3 of original plan (~170 edits across 10 secondary docs) at .claude/plans/spec-fix-plan.md. 1205 tests passing, 0 analyzer issues."
