description: Session startup - verify previous work, determine next task.
---

Run this FIRST every session before any work.

## Steps

1. Read ARCHITECT_BRIEFING.md — understand current phase status,
   test count, open items, and what comes next
2. Run flutter test — fix any failures before new work
3. Run flutter analyze — fix any issues before new work
4. Check git status — handle any uncommitted changes from a
   previous session

## If Your Context Was Just Compacted

Re-read ARCHITECT_BRIEFING.md immediately. Do not continue from
memory — compaction clears your working state. Verify where you
are from the file, then resume.

## Then

Read the phase prompt from Reid carefully. It was drafted by the
Architect and contains exactly what to build. Follow it precisely.
