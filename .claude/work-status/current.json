Start with Pass 11. Each pass should try a NEW angle not covered by previous passes. Read .claude/audit-reports/2026-02-09-implementation-review.md for all prior findings — do NOT re-report known issues. Only report genuinely NEW findings. When a pass finds 0 new issues, update status to complete and note that convergence is achieved. THEN the next instance after that should fix all issues."
