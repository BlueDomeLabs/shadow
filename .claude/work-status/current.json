  "notes": "Phase 20b complete. Added String? baselinePhotoPath to UpdateConditionInput and String? photoPath to UpdateConditionLogInput. Regenerated freezed files. Wired both fields through update use cases and screens. baselinePhotoPath uses ?? merge (no Remove button on condition edit). photoPath uses direct assignment (Remove button on log screen needs null to clear). 4 new use case unit tests. Screen test mocks upgraded to capture update inputs; photo assertions strengthened. 3,274 tests passing. Analyzer clean. Next: await Architect review."
