  "notes": "Fixed all 15 violations identified in spec review. CODING_STANDARDS Section 7 refactored to remove duplicate implementations, now references API_CONTRACTS as canonical. Fixed 8 enums with explicit int values (DietPresetType, InsightCategory, DataScope, AccessLevel, AuthorizationDuration, WriteOperation, RuleSeverity, FoodCategory, InsightPriority). Removed duplicate enum definitions and added cross-references. Ready to commit."
