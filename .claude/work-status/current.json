  "notes": "Completed P7-1 (standardized 5 DAOs from comma-separated to JSON arrays for List<String> storage) and P7-2 (improved FoodItem servingSize parsing for edge cases like '100g'). Documented 6 more spec-only issues as SPEC-FIX-003 through SPEC-FIX-008 in 53_SPEC_CLARIFICATIONS.md. All 1205 tests passing, analyzer clean. Remaining: P8-1/P8-2/P8-3 (missing tests for 10/14 entities - large effort) and 21 LOW issues. Full findings at .claude/audit-reports/2026-02-09-implementation-review.md."
