Task B: PhotoProcessingService created with processStandard/processHighDetail — compress, EXIF strip (keepExif: false), SHA-256 hash. flutter_image_compress ^2.3.0 added (resolved to 2.4.0). Wired into photo_entry_gallery_screen (_pickPhoto), condition_edit_screen (_pickBaselinePhoto with processHighDetail), condition_log_screen (_pickPhoto), fluids_entry_screen (_pickBowelPhoto). 5 new unit tests. DECISIONS.md updated with two entries. Encryption deferred. Next: await Architect review."
