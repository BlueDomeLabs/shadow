  "notes": "Phase 29 complete. Created CorrelationViewScreen: photos shown newest-first with ±48h health event window, loading 8 repos in parallel. Added as 5th card in ReportsTab. Filter sheet supports date preset (30d/90d/all), photo areas, and 7 event categories. Fixed production bug where _CorrelationKey was recomputed from DateTime.now() in build() causing infinite reload. 8 new widget tests. Next: await Architect review."
